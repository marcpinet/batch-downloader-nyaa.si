# bulk-download-from-nyaa.si

My first scrapper! It is focused on making simplier to bulk download torrents from Nyaa.si

<h1> How it Works </h1>
Everything is written into the script as a comment. If you want to add an anime, removing one, adding or removing a provider like Erai-Raws or SubsPlease etc. You'll need to edit the different lists that are included. For beginners, I also added a tutorial for editing lists in Python.

You specify the anime name, the episode where you want to start downloading, and then the last episode.

Just click and have fun waiting (it's really fast).
Every downloaded torrent will be stored in a dedicated folder in the same folder as the script.

<h1> Requirements </h1>

With the command pip install <library> you'll need to install the following ones :
  
  • NyaaPy
  • win10toast
