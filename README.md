## Getting Started

This script is being controlled through a user interface. 
For beginners, that is why the main is a `.pyw` rather than a `.py` one.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Support 👨‍💻

Any problems with running the script and any questions please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/marcpinet/batch-downloader-nyaa.si/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

You can also contribute to this project by requesting new features [here](https://github.com/marcpinet/batch-downloader-nyaa.si/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

I never ask for money for my open source projects. However, you can still tip me if you want.
